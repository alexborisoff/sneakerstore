# React v.18 + TypeScript + Webpack + SCSS Modules

Hi, visitor to my GitHub account.

My name is Alex and in my free time I prefer to program and immerse myself
in the world of development.

This application displays the operation of an online store selling branded sneakers of various companies.

To run the application, open the project in any of the source-code editors (e.g. Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, etc.). Then type the NPM RUN START command in the terminal of one of the above editors to start the project.
